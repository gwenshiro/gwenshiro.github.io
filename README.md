### biography
My name is Gwen Ong, 18 year old student from Singapore! I am currently studying in a vocational institute (polytechnic) for my diploma in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics. In June 2018, I decided to pick up Web Development as I had found a new-found passion and interest in programming. Since then, I have been coding daily.

My goal is to be able to work as a Freelancer for Web Development by mid 2019 so that I would be able to gain some hands-on experience in preparation for World Skills 2021, as well as to build up a strong portfolio for my future.
