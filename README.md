### BIOGRAPHY
My name is Gwen Ong, 18 year old student from Singapore! I am currently studying in a vocational institute (polytechnic) for my diploma in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics. In June 2018, I decided to pick up Web Development as I had found a discovered my strong passion and interest in programming. Since then, I have been coding daily.

My goal is to be able to work as a Freelancer for Web Development by mid 2019 so that I would be able to gain some hands-on experience in preparation for World Skills 2021, as well as to build up a strong portfolio for my future. 

I also have plans to form a team that works on project basis to assist individuals and companies that seek assistance in the field of Web Development and Design, as well as in Copywriting. Through this, I hope to become an expert at Web Development, gaining experience and exposure to industrial standards, working on my creativity, as well as learning to work with clients and fulfill requests within requirements.

> The purpose of life is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experiences
