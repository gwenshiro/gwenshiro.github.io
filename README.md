Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### biography

My name is Gwen Ong, 18 year old student from Singapore! I am currently studying in a vocational institute (polytechnic) for my diploma in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics. In June 2018, I decided to pick up Web Development as I had found a new-found passion and interest in programming. Since then, I have been coding daily.

My goal is to be able to work as a Freelancer for Web Development by mid 2019 so that I would be able to gain some hands-on experience in preparation for World Skills 2021, as well as to build up a strong portfolio for my future.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/gwenshiro/gwenshiro.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
